Boilerplate project for React code exercise.

To get the dependencies for the project, run `npm install`. To build the project, run `npm run build`.

In preparation for your interview, please ensure that you are able to clone this git repo and run the commands in the README.md.  This will not be the same repository that we will use for your interview but we want to make sure that your machine is able to perform the same operations during the interview.  If you cannot run the commands, please alert us ahead of time if you need to reschedule or find a separate computer that you can use that does work in advance.

Run `npm start` for a dev server. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
