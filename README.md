In preparation for your interview, please ensure that you are able to clone this git repository and run the commands below. This will not be the same repository that we will use for your interview, but we want to make sure that your machine is able to run the application.

If you cannot run the commands, please alert us ahead of time, so that you may reschedule or find a different computer that works.

## Commands

Check if Node.js is installed by running the following command:

```shell
node --version
```

If you receive an error such as `'node' is not recognized`, then install Node.js.

### How to install Node.js (If not installed)

1. Install [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) (Node Version Manager)
2. Run: `nvm use 16`

### Install dependencies

```shell
npm install
```

### Run the application

```shell
npm start
```

In a web browser, navigate to http://localhost:3000/. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
